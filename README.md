# Web Application project - bookstudy

This directory contains the source code about the project developed during the Web Application course.

Description of the project:
A cultural association entrusts our team to develop a Web Application to manage more efficiently the access to the municipal library and improve the 
way of storage their data. Due to COVID pandemic, in the last months the access has been granted by reservation on phone, which is a slow and obsolete method. Therefore, the purpose of the association is allowing their members to access the public library more easily.
In order to accomplish these goals, the new system has to enable the single user to book a seat and other associations to book the main room for meetings. This new method will also allow to better monitor the library occupancy.

The project is developed in PostgreSQL, Java, HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
