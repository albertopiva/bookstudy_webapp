"Score: 10/10

-A good and well-written homework report (some minor English error here and there, be more carefull in the future! -- apps like Grammarly may help you avoid simple errors like third person 's')
–Good the use of filters to protect certain pages.
–A good implementation of REST classes, although a little limited (as you also noted in your report. In the next homework you may want to integrate some jsp pages with REST calls)
–OK the git commits from all members of the group.
–No curl instruction was provided to test the application nor in the report nor in the git repository. When I tried to retrieve some information about a user's resevations for a given conference, no content was present in the server's answer (not even an error message when inserting a wrong ID, or when trying to delete multiple times the same element). Other actions, like the insertion of a new user, were possible from the frontend pages (nice work with hashing the password). Other actions, like the insertion of a conference, was described in the homework. However, no JSON template was provided so I could easily test it.
